# Juno_FIEAPortfolio
Juno Strunk's programming portfolio for applying to FIEA.

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my application. This readme will go over some important information about my projects.

## Wave Function Collapse (WFC Folder)
In this project, I explore the wave function collapse algorithm through tile sets. This project is made using **C++** and **SFML**. All scripts were made by me apart from Tilemap.cpp, which is from SFML's documentation.

Here is a demo of the project
